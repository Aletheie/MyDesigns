# Some of my designs

I came up with designs for projects I would like to code in the near future. The designs are not yet complete. I will add more here over time.

## Personal Web

I purchased a [domain](http://anickaloves.yachts) and would like not to leave it empty, I would also like to do some more advanced project including a blog. The text in the design is random and I have still a few more pages to design.

Link to source code - [Soon]()

## Music Page

I would like to make a relatively simple application where I can practice frontend and backend creation in the only tech stack I know at the moment - MERN, before I start learning next.js
